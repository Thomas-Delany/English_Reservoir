 # English_Reservoir

I founded English Reservoir to provide an intuitive, dynamic, and interactive platform for English learners. In a nutshell, English Reservoir offers a wide array of courses within a subscription-based package.

The English language is the international language of business, science and finance, and the go-to language every person on the planet should learn to communicate with others in an international setting.

Our main page: https://www.englishreservoir.com/ 

Our page for Spain: https://www.englishreservoir.es/

Our listed sites above (.com and .es) use WordPress, however, future ccTLDS that English Reservoir will be built on will be done using Bootstrap. 

In 2024, I will build a template website for English Reservoir with the CSS and JavaScript framework, Bootstrap which will serve as a template for all future country-specific domains. You can follow the process of all future updates to this template in this project. 

This template site that I am building (you can see in this repository) will not be uploaded as a website, however, it will serve as the main template for English Reservoir's domains that will be built on .co.uk, .pl, in, .cn, .fr etc. Further, the filler information for pages, links, headers, mega menu etc. will be in English so you can get a good general idea how I structure the English Reservoir domains. 

All courses and related learning infrastructure are on our subdomain:

It should be noted that our courses, at this point, are geared to the Spanish-speaking world, however, as we progress, we will also cater to many other countries.  

Later on, in 2024, I will embark on my second project which shall be the creation of a new infrastructure for our subdomain (https://cursos.englishreservoir.com/) which will use Moodle and the PHP programming language for the backend. 

Our YouTube channels are where we upload loads of free English learning content. It's here, where you can get a good idea of the layout, style and teaching method of our English courses:
