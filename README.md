# English_Reservoir

I founded English Reservoir to provide an intuitive, dynamic, and interactive platform for English learners. In a nutshell, English Reservoir offers a wide array of courses within a subscription-based package.

The English language is the international language of business, science, and finance, and the go-to language every person on the planet should learn to communicate with others in an international setting.

Our main page: https://www.englishreservoir.com/ 

Our page for Spain: https://www.englishreservoir.es/

Our listed sites above (.com and .es) use WordPress, however, future ccTLDS that English Reservoir will be built on will be done using Bootstrap. 

Moreover, I am building a template website for English Reservoir with the CSS framework, Bootstrap which will serve as a template for all future country-specific domains. You can follow the process of all future updates to this template in this project. 

This template site that I am building (you can see in this repository) will not be uploaded as a website, however, it will serve as the main template for English Reservoir's domains which will be built on .co.uk, .pl, in, .cn, .fr etc. That is, all future domains for English Reservoir will use said template website. Doing this will allow me to streamline all English Reservoir ccTLD's and keep a common framework for an improved workflow, and updating. 

Further, the template website that I am building will essentially be a much needed improved copy of the current website (englishreservoir.com), only it'll be built using Bootstrap and not WordPress. Moreover, it will also contain filler information for pages, links, headers, mega menu etc. which will be in English so you can get a good general idea how I structure the English Reservoir domains. 

All courses and related learning infrastructure are on our subdomain: 

https://cursos.englishreservoir.com/ 

It should be noted that our courses, at this point, are geared to the Spanish-speaking world, however, as we progress, we will also cater to many other countries.  

Later on, in 2024, I will embark on my second project which shall be the creation of a new infrastructure for our subdomain (https://cursos.englishreservoir.com/) which will use Moodle and the PHP programming language for the backend. 

Importantly, given that the template files in this repository are to serve as a template for future English Reservoir domains, I also plan to use these repository files as a continuous testing ground before actually making any changes to said English Reservoir domains. 

Our YouTube channels are where we upload loads of free English learning content. It's here, where you can get a good idea of the layout, style and teaching method of our English courses:
